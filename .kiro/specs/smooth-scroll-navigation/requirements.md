# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the portfolio website's navigation experience by implementing smooth scrolling behavior when users click on navigation links. Instead of instantly jumping to sections, the page will smoothly glide to the target section, creating a more polished and professional user experience.

## Glossary

- **Smooth Scroll**: A gradual, animated transition when navigating between page sections instead of an instant jump
- **Navigation Link**: Clickable elements in the navbar that direct users to different sections (About, Projects, Team, Contact)
- **Section**: A distinct area of the webpage identified by an HTML id attribute
- **Scroll Behavior**: The manner in which the browser moves the viewport when navigating to anchors
- **NavBar Component**: The React component that renders the site navigation menu

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want smooth scrolling when clicking navigation links, so that the page transitions feel polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a navigation link in the navbar THEN the system SHALL smoothly scroll to the target section over a defined duration
2. WHEN smooth scrolling is in progress THEN the system SHALL use an easing function to create natural acceleration and deceleration
3. WHEN a user clicks another navigation link during an ongoing scroll THEN the system SHALL interrupt the current scroll and begin scrolling to the new target
4. WHEN the smooth scroll completes THEN the system SHALL update the browser URL hash to reflect the current section
5. WHEN a user manually scrolls the page THEN the system SHALL not interfere with native scroll behavior

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the navbar to accurately reflect my current section during smooth scrolling, so that I always know where I am on the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN smooth scrolling is in progress THEN the system SHALL update the active navigation indicator based on the visible section
2. WHEN the viewport crosses a section boundary during scroll THEN the system SHALL update the active state within 100 milliseconds
3. WHEN multiple sections are partially visible THEN the system SHALL highlight the navigation link for the section occupying the largest viewport area
4. WHEN smooth scroll completes THEN the system SHALL ensure the correct navigation link is marked as active

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor using keyboard navigation, I want smooth scrolling to work with keyboard interactions, so that I have an accessible navigation experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user activates a navigation link using the keyboard (Enter or Space) THEN the system SHALL trigger smooth scrolling to the target section
2. WHEN a user presses Tab to navigate through links THEN the system SHALL maintain focus visibility throughout the smooth scroll
3. WHEN smooth scrolling is triggered by keyboard THEN the system SHALL provide the same smooth animation as mouse clicks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the smooth scroll implementation to be performant, so that it doesn't negatively impact page performance or user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN smooth scrolling is triggered THEN the system SHALL use requestAnimationFrame for optimal performance
2. WHEN the page contains many elements THEN the system SHALL maintain 60 frames per second during smooth scroll animations
3. WHEN smooth scrolling completes THEN the system SHALL clean up any event listeners or timers to prevent memory leaks
4. WHEN the browser supports native smooth scroll THEN the system SHALL use the native implementation as a fallback option
